						About Tentative<span className="text-green">.</span>
					</h2>
					<p>
						Tentative spawned from the brains of a few people who decided they wanted to form a group, under
						which they can work on projects together or just support each other. As of writing this,
						Tentative consists of two illustrators and a designer and developer of questionable quality.
					</p>
					<p>
						That wasn't meant to be the final name at first. It just served as a stop-gap name until we came
						up with something better, just so we wouldn't need to refer to it as just "the group".

						Even though the name wasn't finalized at the time, I still felt like playing with it a bit,
						experimenting with a few design ideas here and there. Initial ideas used the pixely{" "}

						There wasn't really much rhyme or reason behind the decisions I made here. I just saw this as an
						opportunity to try out two ideas I've had for a while: Using a pixel font and the color purple
						(my favorite (green is a close second)).

						font and (somewhat arbitrarily) decided to focus on the angle of the left stroke of the capital
						"A" in the light (200) weight of the font for the design, which turned out to be 21.5 degrees.
						As a nod to the "TENT" in the name I tried to make the "A" look more like a tent by combining it
						with the left and right strokes from the light and black (900) weights respectively, removing
						the middle bar in the process.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you feel like something's off about that stylized A, you are not alone. We also thought it
						looked weird at some point, so I fixed it.
					</p>
					<video src="/assets/tentative/LogoFix.mp4" autoPlay playsInline muted loop />
					<p>
						Separating the "TIVE" from the "TENTA" part by setting it in the black weight turned turned out
						to be a neat idea, as "TENTA" could now be used as a prefix for other projects, or be
						substituted for the tent icon if space was tight.
					</p>
					<p>... "Tent" and "A"... Tent-A? Whatever.</p>
					<p>
						A somewhat recurring theme is the use of parallelograms and 21.5 degree angles, most prominently
						as an optional design element behind the Tentative wordmark, as well as the website.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Tentative used purple and later a combination of soft gold and green in the first few of
						ideas, the intention this time was to keep Tenative itself monochrome. Instead each member would
						be displayed around their own signature color, putting the focus more on them individually.
						However this would have made any materials about the group itself look really boring, so we
						ultimately decided on <span className="text-violet-500">violet</span> to be Tentative's main
						brand color.

							<p>
								First of all: Since Tentative has members from various different parts of the world, we
								thought it would be neat to localize the site into languages that each member can speak
								and write well. That means the site will (eventually) be available in English, German,
								French, Japanese and Thai.

						Every member has their own logo in a different style. To achieve some feeling of uniformity, I
						introduced unique icons for each member in an early concept of the site. The icons represent a
						certain element about that member's branding, their character, or whatever else. These icons are
						made in a 7x7 pixel grid for more simplicity, but also flexibility. These can be used at small
						scale as they are, or at large scale with other effects like borders and gradients.
