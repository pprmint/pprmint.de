				"text3": "However, buying Glyphs would be an investment, and a potential return on investment would be nice.",
				"text4": "Mina Sans is going to be my first paid font. My goal is to create a variable font with features like character variants, contextual alternatives and tabular numbers, with extended Latin coverage. Considering the amount of work that would go into this, I think €25-30 would be a fair price for the final product (especially considering what most other font foundries tend to charge).",
				"text5": "If you'd like to help me afford Glyphs I'd greatly appreaciate any Ko-fi donations. If you feel extra generous and would like to try Mina Sans before anyone else, €15 would give you access to early versions as I create them and net you a chance to influence the final design with your feedback.",
				"text6": "My heartfelt thanks along with links to download the font will be sent to the email address used for your donation. If you don't hear from me after 2 days, please <Link>contact me</Link>.",
				"text7": "To set expecations straight: <b>Creating fonts takes a lot of time and effort.</b> I might not release updates very frequently and it might take a long time until there's a production-ready version. I only have so much free time and want to make Mina Sans the best it can be, so I ask for your patience."
