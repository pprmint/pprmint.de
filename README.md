My personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Getting started.

`pnpm i` to get a fuckton of packages.

`pnpm dev` to look at the site on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The [.env.example](.env.example) file contains various credentials for Payload and the S3 storage adapter, along with details to SMTP mail transfer.
